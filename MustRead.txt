In the files available, javaProject.rar contains whole project i.e the front end of the database.

And the BackEndData.sql file contains all the tables, views, structures, data, connections and all the data
that you will needing to create a database for this project.

In the backend data there is a structure called access which contains the login credentials of hotel.

Similarly structure called access1 contains login credentials of vehicle.

But for the complete information and overview regarding the backend database refer the Files- (ER diagrams & Schema diagram)
which i have uploaded in the repository.

I have used extra libraries such as Mysql-connector and jCalender.

To connect backend and front end i have made use of Mysql-connector which also requires some coding in order 
to establish the connection between backend and front end.

I have used jCalender during transaction process in both hotel and vehicle.
